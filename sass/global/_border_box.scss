/**
 * Fixed box-sizing for all elements. This is using the latest recommended
 * code as of August 2014 per Paul Irish.
 *
 * Excerpt from the article: Due to browser support, this recommendation is
 * only for projects that support IE8 and up. (Full browser compat at MDN)
 * Firefox <= 28 still needs the -moz- prefix, and <= iOS4, Android <= 2.3
 * need the -webkit-, but everyone else uses the unprefixed. You can find more
 * info about a box-sizing polyfill for IE6 & 7 at html5please.com/#box-sizing
 * (which was developed with * { box-sizing: border-box!).
